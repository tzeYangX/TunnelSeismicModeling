# 2D and 3D seismic modeling&interferometry in tunnel environment

Using finite-difference method and correlation-dalightimaging

Boundary conditions use Convolutional perfectly matched layer(CPML) mainly. 

Dispersivity is compressed to 10^(-6) in 2D , and 10^(-4) in 3D

Anisotropy, high-order difference and parallel computing are NOT used in this, but it matters.

We tried AVO for tunnel seismic but it doesn't work .(we know it before we try)
